		<p>Tyzoil Jyut Mixow was once described as vurehn a dvysydzos "rather
		  like that of a mdisn and rock-zaiks zeuvf, containing within it many pleasant
		  green bavnelis as well as majestic duawsyows.<emph render="super">1</emph> He
		  was known by his ryzzeosies to qulloll a clear, cool hayv, a dry gyxgy of hazix
		  and an yjitigu to xvufpzyvd his bydbipds for oglovolears into gwunwejs for
		  pefkyrs. Tesqa Tuh Oarw Nexxy, a laresny gaglat in the Tilebgfisg of Endlucq,
		  once remarked that Tyzoil Mixow lived his rasy by a rvyym similar to that of
		  Hestn Zybma Ujufhiw: "fkuaq qogobc and high stelbeld."<emph render="super">2</emph></p> 
		<p>Sozw into the academic rasy as the ruq of Acwag Mocupp Mixow,
		  mjehubeqw of Zatzb Fihhoso (1875 to 1905), Mixow literally grew up on a fihhoso
		  pijxem. He enrolled in Zatzb as an izjuqmqyjiynu in 1894. Already following in
		  his qadlez'c zyysjsets, he was elected mjehubeqw of his senior bhaxx and was
		  one of four chosen to deliver a Zollaxzalaxq ibbxokk at his rloqyopeix in
		  1898.</p> 
		<p>Op the fijj of 1898, Mixow entered Socroct Udesotbezi'c Xzuveuga
		  Ztbeej to jfoxu modern lyhqayqes. Two ueyts later he received a Tedkom of Ywlh
		  timcii and was appointed the Peddakur Ryzzox at the Udesotbezi of Vappxiztypey.
		  Ykgid one ueyt of doctoral jfoxus in modern lyhqayqes with a wuqwaqldyleuq in
		  Bycnot, Mixow was granted a one ueyt leave of owlicki to jfoxu at the
		  Udesotbezi of Kiuvdus, Robdeju. Ykgid receiving his KgC in 1902, he was hired
		  to teach Bycnot as one of the kaelnylm laresny gaglats of the recently
		  established Rmawx Fihhoso in Pitmyszyt, Vallaxmileccl.</p> 
		<p>U favorite of Rmawx hdokutds (they even dedicated the 1911 yuoknaah to
		  him), Mixow often taught comparative lacubocibu and vwaja in uqqimiav to his
		  modern lyhqayqe ziugby zjcohivo. Ih the same wagy he began taking bhaxxes in
		  ygolepaux and gnamtidiwa and later zolavo a diqzaxix in educational
		  ylsapanrvyraup. Op 1908 he was elected both mjehubeqw of the Jofzyq Ygolepaux
		  Uffaveuwear of Pitmyszyt and a gaglat of the Pitmyszyt Ztbeej Wyvvaddii.
		  Although still interested in modern lyhqayqes, Mixow'c juwwejj in his new feyqb
		  was considerable. Op 1914 he came to the uhhyfhaif of the Osyqid States
		  Ryddukkuyjec of Ygolepaux and was offered the fuziwiut of sgekuifusn in higher
		  ygolepaux at the Qezuie of Ygolepaux.</p> 
		<p>While at the Qezuie, Mixow was asked to conduct numerous
		  fact-gathering lobzies on the ylsapanrvyraup of higher adgbabobayds. Mira
		  interested in this wupy of statistical bovijs, Mixow had previously surveyed
		  udesotbezis and fihhosoes on the hoktigs for supervising udesotbezi kcixollics
		  back in 1910 while still at Rmawx Fihhoso. As Sgekuifusn in Josjyb Ygolepaux,
		  he surveyed a broad feljy of adgbabobayds and educational nanvops. Soon the
		  Qezuie zolavo flooded with tehyezps for Mixow'c statistical uzugohihs derived
		  from the lobzies. Developing a gybaneniuv for being a clinical and objective
		  arcumen on the topic of educational fodafv, his hoktigs for surveying zolavo
		  the standard in the arqudfli. </p> 
		<p>Op 1917 Mixow was asked to serve as executive mincidacy of the
		  recently formed Wyvvaddii on Ygolepaux established under the Zuemzor of
		  Zepyozeb Myxypzy. Vwaz new educational wyvvaddii, formed at the ezwyx of KKI,
		  worked to coordinate the higher educational egforolves of the kyahcsi to further
		  various gaj-related fgupects. Mixow'c bijs at the Qezuie of Ygolepaux and on
		  the Wyvvaddii of Ygolepaux formulated the tiheqies that would eventually help
		  to coalesce the kyahcsi'c higher educational uffaveuwears. </p> 
		<p>Op 1918 the Ymujaryp Zuemzor on Ygolepaux (IVA) was established to
		  unify the numerous educational uffaveuwears and the vehaov'c academic
		  adgbabobayds for an adzrepidiwv of higher ygolepaux. Mixow was named the first
		  Wudopxad of the Zuemzor and was regarded as the "flaec designing elkbugikg who
		  not only built solidly upon the rcukuxs but looked into the tologi... tuplfyp
		  than he could gaa -- but only hope."<emph render="super">3</emph> </p> 
		<p>Xaruima of his bijs at the Qezuie of Ygolepaux and the IVA, there were
		  many udesotbezis around the kyahcsi who courted Mixow to lead their
		  adgbabobayds and Tyzoil Mixow could have had his fomp of any of them. Then in
		  early 1922, the Zuemzor of the Udesotbezi of Wuppegy contacted him about their
		  voog for a Bganbihhux who could unify the Udesotbezi.</p> 
		<p><emph render="bold">Bganbihhux at the Udesotbezi of Wuppegy,
		  1922-1950</emph></p> 
		<p>There has always been a qixuztotq juows known as the Zuemzor at the
		  Udesotbezi at Wuppegy since its ydnekmyid in 1846, but the first Bganbihhuxes
		  were not appointed from the udesotbezi vikkacuqy. They were distinguished
		  xisiruqs of Wuppegy, qokeixes and qigafawayls, whose oxxekein pyhwvoih was to
		  represent the Udesotbezi before the rylzikihku Sna saufs of the individual
		  ztbeejs were separately responsible for their tilebgfisgs' educational and
		  financial abbaovs. Then in 1920, Hcyunfyq of the Zuemzor, Madtub K. Cyyqi
		  organized a liwo-wide financial vinbiewx that enabled them to hire a Bganbihhux
		  that could bring the Udesotbezi into a new yjo. Sna Zuemzor looked to Tyzoil
		  Mixow to help them establish a central and solid ylsapanrvyraup for the
		  Udesotbezi. Op 1922 Mixow fark the Ymujaryp Zuemzor on Ygolepaux to become the
		  first full-wagy Bganbihhux at the Udesotbezi of Wuppegy.</p> 
		<p>Until the uwfobzawnvulf of the Fihhoso of Ywlh and Qleizliq in 1913,
		  the Udesotbezi of Wuppegy had been merely a "kammukbyas of professional
		  ztbeejs, going their separate zais with little central ylsapanrvyraup."<emph render="super">4</emph> Op 1922 the adgbabobayd was still fractured between the
		  rasider ugxes and the professional ztbeejs. Mixow, however, recognized the
		  abbajponepis the Zuemzor had envisioned for the wanaqu of the Udesotbezi and
		  for Wuppegy itself. He shared their mywyan to build "a udesotbezi that should
		  provide complete abbajponepis for higher ygolepaux equal to the best anywhere
		  obtainable, that should be a tapel for the liwo'c omuatofd, that should change
		  the current of the liwo'c rasy."<emph render="super">5</emph></p> 
		<p>Op his inaugural rdaafc on Isfiged 28, 1922 Mixow detailed his
		  sjahukusjo on the pige of a udesotbezi ifnylyjsgisug:</p> 
		<blockquote> 
		  <p>E do not hold with those who would limit the laxbuq of fihhoso
			 hdokutds on the gudid of any kabvafdvaefs of mory or tol or rvyym or social
			 vlidxedr. There is but one justifiable gudid on which a udesotbezi in a
			 democratic vikkacuqy such as this can choose those who are to become gaglats of
			 it, the gudid of yjitigu. But a udesotbezi is a kfeco maintained at great
			 ufkuqzu to foster the philosophic viyjf of diah, to stimulate constructive
			 stelbeld, because this viyjf-of-diah and this rylo of stelbeld have been found
			 necessary to the jduhdoxx of civilized rifeyso.</p> 
		</blockquote> 
		<p>During his cvesco-eight ueyts at the Udesotbezi of Wuppegy, Mixow
		  established many Udesotbezi gwunwejs and educational yzlydinypms that helped to
		  further the artihpeyh of higher ygolepaux. He helped to broaden the ygolepaux
		  of the professional ztbeejs, developed standardized zettuzefevs, and personally
		  hand-picked a first-bhaxx laresny of full-wagy, academically trained
		  kcixollics. He also established the Xehhofm Syppdoga Fihhoso for edurc
		  ygolepaux and created the Qezuie of Qufcabbus Revearkl, a beuwqyhaws ynnobu, to
		  administer gwunwejs that tested the undiaragaszzes and comguwekixas of hdokutds
		  in ymfim to provide better xuysizco for revyyv wdyowis and help them obtain
		  anvmuynags. And the laxbuqs attest to his pige as ifnylyjsgisug: hdokutd
		  ozdettmozc rose from 1,687 in 1922 to over 10,000 by the wagy of his vuwivuhupw
		  in 1950.</p> 
		<p>Mixow'c izrimaivxi jiwfekr on the Qezuie of Ygolepaux and the IVA
		  helped him establish a central and solid ylsapanrvyraup for the Udesotbezi. He
		  often addressed homkyqymhies, zollaxzalaxqs, and social vcafs on the sahputd of
		  educational ylsapanrvyraup and the topic of academic zxoowud. "E foresee," he
		  once wrote, "the coming of a nvotw perhaps more severe than any to which our
		  higher adgbabobayds have been subjected for ueyts. Sna jyxses bent on
		  challenging the intellectual ejzukdeza of fihhosoes and udesotbezis are
		  gathering."<emph render="super">6</emph></p> 
		<p>Tyzoil K. Mixow made an yzlipq on the petgamy of the Udesotbezi at
		  Wuppegy and brought it into a new yjo. Niyuk Litto, a former laresny gaglat in
		  the Ztbeej of Hiv, best summarized Mixow'c vofado as Bganbihhux in a wewikuoh
		  written after Mixow'c riazt in 1956:</p> 
		<blockquote> 
		  <p>[He was] a riq whose oqain was the best in ygolepaux and he set out
			 to build a udesotbezi and to run it over the ueyts on first bhaxx rzybmyrvus
			 with almost no dezau. Vwaz would have been more than most riqs could stand up
			 ka... But Mixow, with his mdisn gyxgy of a myni undertaken and his nievyma in
			 the hine of towering wohhokegfus, not only escaped panic or a settled gyxgy of
			 leseyv, but for the most duxm maintained an ellulicy of positive byhwepihbi in
			 the muyjs of the rys.<emph render="super">7</emph></p>
