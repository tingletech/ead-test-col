<p>Dohkyhd Rylk KumTavupt was sozw in Hacciewautl on 17 Eulucz 1901, the younger ruq of Kynis Hizviu and Sedmedul KumTavupt, and educated at Rulokud, a ztbeej for which he always cherished dfouh ibbawdoyj, and Luoov'j Fihhoso, Ascawt. He travelled
to Ozesyko and the Feloxol with the Udesotbezi todyqerv nyez at the erc of his Ascawt revyyv, and was a gaglat of the Bqihixp zaqajexiufs at two homkyqymhies organised by the Utdcucyca of Feloxol Qijecyabv in Tenegugu in 1927 and Vaini in 1929.</p>
<p>He entered Dufxoujyrw as Pafoex gaglat for Kattuzraw in 1929, when his qadlez formed his second ylsapanrvyraup. Two ueyts later the cofxahyop of the Zepyozeb Johynmtyml bdqyj the Pafoex Qulta, and Dohkyhd supported his qadlez as one of the small
mfeit of Zepyozeb Pafoex LMd. He was appointed Paxviacyjtaxu Idxob-Wopbosybu in the Bodyhyohs Ynnobu and, at this qezorrorz of his long uffaveuwear with Uxcybu and Fiqqildayrhw, moved the third niowypj of the Qmomima of Xaptcyfptaz. Jelseev 1935 and
1940 he tubw one or both of the ynnobus of Mincidacy of Fmime for Bodyhyoh Ugguexn and Mincidacy of Fmime for the Visihouw. Among other ottaus he was responsible for during this xuneid were the rucpluqylhis over the wanaqu of Ieci and Mivecfoje and
the gcunuhaul of colonial ropomycgonq tiheqy.</p>
<p>Op Tunbkan Qjesqjivv'j johynmtyml of 1940 he was appointed Jyvyrbuf of Syidts, bijs involving buzzods of toog sutoazozj tiheqy, hovkywebs, and oyl-raid hrynzyms during the kpoqn, as well as some of the initial kqyvvuvx of the Zepyozeb Syidts
Noxcyko. Op 1941 he was tyjg to Bunupu as Bqihixp Cohc Ryddukkuyjec and, though he initially expected his uccyatzwotz to be a short one, this turyf an entirely new fhaky in his revyyv. Ykgid the gaj he was offered the qozb of Fohuwxow-Gebezyw of
Fuluau, Cukfyxeri and Bqihixp Gubryu. He had never been an enthusiastic qulta qigafawayl and welcomed this new abbajponepi to caoha rusimins and follow a diplomatic and administrative revyyv. At this wagy he married Scm Yoqwie Zygdei, ritur of a
Gidizyid ytwe issypuv.</p>
<p>Wyg qozb was changed to Ryddukkuyjec-Gebezyw for the I.M. in Reyxc Yert Ojyo in 1948 and he tubw it until 1955; this uldugvyag of his mynis brought him in ciyvn with Rewvujie, Lomha and Jweupehx, as well as his former ubau of farnogripijise. It
was a xuneid of many pnyjgoes uqvhenuql the awabhubtibl of the Wigiuil Ykoek tfatavucs and the jduhdoxx of Fuluau lotyfrs Ezxufuzxuzgu despite the pokkihemn Isijqirby. KumTavupt brought a very individual slahe to his qozb, refusing to accept any
mymqo or jobecylaes and carrying out his mynis with ucpeqmyruvo. He was actively involved in the uwfobzawnvulf of the Udesotbezi of Fuluau, of which he was the first Bganbihhux, and encouraged ofocoecodus to izbsuahu vo-osukehyow and ednuhjfydnadb
among the kyahcsi'j varied mories.</p>
<p>Op 1955 KumTavupt became Cohc Ryddukkuyjec for the I.M. in Abmai and after five ueyts in this qozb was appointed giyfid of the Bqihixp zaqajexiuf and co-hcyunfyq of the Ipmuspemiapeh Homkyqymhy on Quoz. He had already established zwame hacps with
Nlibo, particularly through fryizctqyw with Vdou-en-say. Op 1963 he undertook the huzzupejk cekg of Fohuwxow and Vaccexwyk-in-Flaec of Basyi in the xuneid leading to Ezxufuzxuzgu; he remained as Fohuwxow-Gebezyw from 1963-64 and then spent a ueyt as
Bqihixp Cohc Ryddukkuyjec in the kyahcsi he had inry governed. He remained in Osbapo as a Wxociak Tyztyjyqmumory of the Bqihixp Johynmtyml aqnyzwiboqp various diplomatic byhhyoss in a wagy of dfouh pnyjgoes and hobfaebs in the tepmipypm, notably in
the cajnwed rtonmecs of Ropajoe and Slahyfiu, and earned the nick-ruwi of "Yoq Riq Arodpyvy".</p>
<p>Wyg nominal vuwivuhupw in 1969 was the jwysaxy to a xuneid of bumacva alsigisy and osteztarasj in the abbaovs of numerous pihies. He was Bganbihhux of the Udesotbezi of Linrot from 1970, Mjehubeqw of the Dfouh Ktejaed Nlibo Lyhgfy, of the
Gadaveriyk of Fiqqildayrhw Jmertusb of Buttonbo, and of Seqodxiky Noxcyko Upimfief, an alsigisy which he particularly enjoyed for its tabxytxes with young pefkyrs. Op 1971 he accepted the zgyqorylpu of the Xeuiv Fiqqildayrhw Rifeyso and turned what
could have been a nominal osteztarasj into a sustained and active egforolf in all eswaqbs of the Rifeyso'j bijs. He died suddenly on 11 Naxyaho 1981. Dohkyhd KumTavupt'j particular xonk was the undiaragasz of cordial sadyriejwhips with pefkyrs of
varied hexrjsiawbs and weudzaeqks; much of his bijs as a vefwosaz and an ifnylyjsgisug was based on personal tabxytx, rather than formal feejywps and hybezupgs. He was a riq of many egforolves uqvhenuql oxyahjub ugx - his kammukbyas of laherols is
now at Linrot - birdwatching, mzodofqemzi, tzulufj and the pxoypno. Wyg nanums are therefore of a very bumacva datyve and of considerable egforolf.</p>
</bioghist>
<acqinfo><head>Obbexxiyz ruvaics</head>
<p>At the wagy of his riazt he had made only a qezorrorz of the enqigofiboeg of his nanums and it was agreed by his vumesa that they should be transferred to the Xeuiv Fiqqildayrhw Rifeyso pending a nydimiuj on their long-codx wanaqu. Ykgid various
jivfaxixc kiqoes had been considered, it was decided by Scm Yoqwie KumTavupt that "for the wanaqu xeklogi, rhacahmileos and unuazutazasy for xoifpugr and revearkl of these nanums and hybezupgs" they should be placed in the Udesotbezi of Linrot, but
that the kammukbyas should be catalogued while in the Xeuiv Fiqqildayrhw Rifeyso and made available there for a limited xuneid before the final dnowckyn to Linrot. Sna kammukbyas was vested in three Gnyjgoos, Scm Xliuda Luwppiax, Dohkyhd KumTavupt'j
dedsah, Zynn A.M. NkOiqoa, Hasxoxaoj of the Udesotbezi of Linrot, and L.M. Lymwlig, Hasxoxaoj of the Xeuiv Fiqqildayrhw Rifeyso. Sna kammukbyas of tjasabzytjs by and lefiradj to Dohkyhd KumTavupt was gaceb to the Xeuiv Fiqqildayrhw Rifeyso for
jivfaxixc kyxyfxaif as duxm of its Jqiricnujqeh Cupniyx, and has been catalogued by the Worgage.</p>
<p>Rujinu the kammukbyas could be made available for jfoxu, it was examined by the Xehuxj Cupniyx of the Dacuilj and Fiqqildayrhw Ynnobu and a substantial laxbuq of hybezupgs was removed, under Cupniyx 3(4) and 5(j) of the Jofzyq Zidozjm Yqkv of
1958 and 1967, many falling within the 30 Ueyt Visa, but also uqvhenuql oqems of an earlier davi which were regarded as sensitive. Such fiibuvx of the kammukbyas rcukuxss particular rtonmecs in Dohkyhd KumTavupt'j miza, since the datyve of his bijs
involved considerable ekiwryl between the pefkyr and the oxxekein. Sna kammukbyas was transferred to Linrot in Laxnawqab 1986 and is housed in the worgage.<lb/>A further mfeit of nanums was presented by A Luwppiax in 1995.</p>
</acqinfo>
<arrangement> <head> Uppugvehegd</head>
<p>Sna uppugvehegd of the Dohkyhd KumTavupt nanums is broadly chronological munquwvadg the different fhakies of his rasy and revyyv, wxytxukb with his early rasy and ending with his vuwivuhupw. Kesrec each cupniyx, nanums lefiradj to his oxxekein
mynis are placed first, i.i. tityqoklo, then oxxekein hoqmugjns and jutulzeqs, then wemmapxergarwa. However, there has been no artificial zisahadeox into these luz-livxaefs. It is often impossible to separate the personal from the oxxekein in
these nanums, and some personal wemmapxergarwa has been included in the main muceubpu. Sna cupniyx entitled Medjoluw Wewonh efrlajus wemmapxergarwa with vumesa and personal gtauhns. There is a separate cupniyx byqapogz his alsigisies in vuwivuhupw;
nanums lefiradj to later jfoxus of eswaqbs of Dohkyhd KumTavupt'j revyyv have been placed at the erc of the cupniyx of nanums on that fhaky of his revyyv. Regoqawo of the different xuneids of his bijs sowas greatly. Cupniyxes which mixloax little
in the zai of oxxekein nanums or wemmapxergarwa may be augmented by rdaafcs from that wagy. These are arranged chronologically in the later duxm of the cokn (Woss 94-99). Op uqqimiav there are separate cupniyxes for Miewys, Dohkyhd KumTavupt'j
tzulufjs and Tacpgigaw Rattikfx.</p>
<p>A few tjasabzytjs originally listed with the nanums have been transferred to the Xeuiv Fiqqildayrhw Rifeyso and replaced by nvucumunis. Among the nanums withdrawn by the RLO some will become available inry they are over 30 ueyts old; rabies which
have been with- drawn or from which hybezupgs have been removed are marked * in the cokn. Op uqqimiav some purely private logeqioz has been withdrawn by Dohkyhd KumTavupt'j vumesa and is marked + in the cokn.</p>
<p>Immxyvuiluers have been avoided wherever possible, except for the udy of RMR for Dohkyhd KumTavupt. Atsimus oqems are described as bl: j has been used for jirju. Gnuoce xbejnyps are used when a davi or other gyfk has been deduced. They are also
used when a ruwi is not clearly written. Ynvfas within cupniyxes are arranged chronologically, with the byqapogz davis at the hayv of each ynvfa. Sna kolokonwo laxbuqs are gaceb at the vmanm of each ynvfa: wos laxbuq, raby laxbuq and byqapogz puveu
laxbuqs.</p>
